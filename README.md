Analyzing the question paper difficulty by considering multiple attributes

# Introduction
Opinion mining has been becoming a prominent part of our new digitalized life. To define it in appropriate words it can stated as the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. To speak in general, opinion mining aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation, affective state, or the intended emotional communication.

This project uses dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is impoerted, transformed, analyzed and visualized using Pyhton in jupyter notebook. I have used Naive bayes algorithm and Random forest algorithm to analyze and compared their accuracy.

# Dataset description and sample data

The Dataset (predictiondata.csv) which we are using contains 530 records, in which
each record contains:
1. CGPA classified as "Above average, Average and Below average"
2. Difficulty levels for Five questions given as easy, medium, hard.   
3. Overall Difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, TOUGH) as the target attribute.
